If you’ve decided to donate blood for a specific reason or you just want to help out, you may be curious about what to expect. Giving blood is a simple, safe way to make a big difference in people’s lives. Knowing what to expect before, during, and after you donate can help you prepare for the process.

How Donating Helps
Every 2 seconds, someone in the United States needs blood. Donating blood can help:

● People who go through disasters or emergency situations

● People who lose blood during major surgeries

● People who have lost blood because of a gastrointestinal bleed

● Women who have serious complications during pregnancy or childbirth

● People with cancer or severe anemia sometimes caused by thalassemia or sickle cell disease

 

Before You Donate
If you think you want to donate blood, it’s important to make sure you meet the requirements and that you properly prepare.

First, you’ll need to find a blood bank or blood drive and make an appointment. Be sure to ask about any specific requirements for donors and what kinds of identification you need to bring with you. Tell the person on the phone if you have health concerns or problems or if you’ve recently traveled outside the country.

In the weeks before your appointment, you’ll want to make sure you’re getting a healthy amount of iron in your diet. Meat and seafood, as well as vegetables like spinach and sweet potatoes are good sources of iron. Certain breads, fruits, and other foods like beans and tofu can be good options too.

The day of your appointment, prepare yourself by drinking plenty of fluids and wearing comfortable clothes with sleeves that you can easily roll up above your elbow. Make sure you have a list of all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you’re taking, as well as the proper forms of ID.
